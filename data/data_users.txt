STORY: I thought Avengers: Endgame has the best story in the MCU because it was trying to entertain the audience because it was A story of action, regret, tragity and courage. I give the story an A+ CHARACTERS: The characters in this movie were pretty interesting. Of course it wasn't there first MCU appearance, but still, there interesting characters. A big C+. CONCLUSION: Avengers: Endgame was an epic, heartbreaking, movie. Definitely the best Marvel movie ever.
4.5

Probably the best movie ever!

I love it. I wish I could have more time to go and see again. The only thing I didn't like was the death of Iron Man, but the movie was awesome.
2.5
5
I'm still pissed that they killed off Widow! Also I know they made Captain Marvel after Endgame, but she was capable of so much more. While I enjoyed seeing characters that aren't normally in the same movie together, I felt like there were too many to really spend enough time with each.
3
5
I can't believe they killed Thanos like that. Thanos was just trying to live his life as a farmer, after dominating 50% of the population and Thor just came in and killed him. Unbelievable, I cried and I don't usually cry. This is making me emotional just typing this. Other than that, the game was epic and I cried at the end when iron man died.
5
5
Emotional while captivating and at times hilarious!

Affects were good. Film was too long and drawn out. We got bored and left early.
5
5
Best culmination of films in the past century.

You always wonder how Marvel can top themselves in their movies. Well, Avengers: Endgame tops everything they've ever made. This is a finale that was worth the wait.
5
5
This was so good I saw it twice! I collected Marvel comics as a kid and have the this series. WOW!
5
5
Third time seeing it, and it just keeps getting better and better! My favorite Marvel movie!
5
5
The perfect ending to an amazing franchise of characters that we grew to love over 10 years.
5
5
Tremendous finale to an amazing chapter of the Marvel Universe. Highly recommend!

I always enjoyed the Marvel Universe especially the avengers. I thought the movie was very well thought out and planned well. The Avengers Endgame made for a good cap to the series. I liked the idea of the time travel using quantum physics, since that is my niche. I am particularly fond of the the Stan Lee tribute at the end.

Too long but ultimately enjoyable.

Three words, exciting, epic and fun. probably the best movie not only marvel, also the best of 2019

The best movie I've ever seen. I cried the whole time.

Best movie in my life lot of lessons! It was my 6th time I believe seeing this.

It was an okay addition to the MCU but it fell short due to the numerous plotholes that come with the concept of time travel. The film also had some jokes that didn't land, most of which related to Thor and his weight gain as a result of his depression.

Horrible way to end it. They should have ended at Infinity War. Let’s face it, was Thanos really the bad guy?

Thoroughly enjoyable.

A bit long.
0.5
5
Every person that saw this movie was tricked into believing that what they saw was good. Disney put out a movie that was 3 hours and 5minutes with 2 hours of footage that was already seen or unrelavant. It was anticlimactic and overall boring. You watch scenes from the first avengers and infinity war just to arrive at an “epic battle” that would ruin the actual marvel timeline and movie to come. They had a poor excuse for a time travel theory so that they could make this terrible movie. Waste of TIME and money. Glad they made a movie to please the comic book fans, rather than just taking my money.

Why was it so long? No-One would have known the Comics, from yesterday-years.

Avengers Endgame turned Thanos, a man who wanted to save the universe, into someone who wanted to end it. Doing this gets all of the things like Thanos is right into Thanos was wrong.

It dragged on and it didn't have much of a plot. Quite frankly, it was disappointing.

Boring and dull first half. Predictable story line that has been done a million times in tv shows and movies. Ending scene was good but not good enough for the hour I wasted sitting through the beginning.
