I can't believe they killed Thanos like that. Thanos was just trying to live his life as a farmer, after dominating 50% of the population and Thor just came in and killed him. Unbelievable, I cried and I don't usually cry. This is making me emotional just typing this. Other than that, the game was epic and I cried at the end when iron man died.
It was an okay addition to the MCU but it fell short due to the numerous plotholes that come with the concept of time travel. The film also had some jokes that didn't land, most of which related to Thor and his weight gain as a result of his depression.
Too long and too slow at the beginning
A bit long.
It was okay. Not the best movie of the year. Shaft was better.
Very slow start, not bad but could have been much better, rather lack luster considering it ends the Marvel series.
It seemed to drag in places.
I have enjoyed many of the Marvel movies but missed the comedy and witty banter in this movie.
It was good. Not as good as the hype.
Not a lot of action.
It was good, but a bit slow moving in parts.
Too long to get to the point, otherwise it was okay.
I was expecting more.
